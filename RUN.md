## To Run

This is setup with [docker](https://docker.com/). If you have docker installed, simply run

```
$ docker compose up
```

If not, visit [docker](https://docker.com/) to install. 

Alternatively, this is built using Python 3.10+. Some features would not work with older version of Python3

If any question, kindly let me know.
